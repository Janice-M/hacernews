 This application uses graphene and Graphene-Django, exposing a simple and powerful API for creating GraphQL servers. 
 
 ## Getting Started 

 * `git clone` https://github.com/Janice-M/hackernews.git

 ## Create a virtual environment 
 * `Install python 3`
 * `Install pip`
 * `Install virtualenv`
 * To create virtual: `python3 -m venv (name of your vitrual mine was 'bluebie')`
 * then activate your virtual `source bluebie/bin/activate`

 ## Installations and dependencies 

 * run `pip install -r requirements.txt`


 ## GraphQL servers 
 * Receive requests using specified GraphQL syntax
 * connect databases/services that are responsible for storing or fetching data
 * return graphql data responses
 * validate incoming requests


## Development process : Schema drivin development 

   :dizzy: When building a GraphQL server is that the main development process will revolve around the schema definition

* Define your types and the appropriate queries and mutations for them.
* Implement functions called resolvers to handle these types and their fields.
* keep doing step one and two as you figure shit out :woman_mechanic:

## tests 

* no tests were written

## Built With 

* Django
* Graphene Django
* Django-GraphQL-JWT
