 This application uses graphene and Graphene-Django, exposing a simple and powerful API for creating GraphQL servers. 
 
 ## GraphQL servers 
 * Receive requests using specified GraphQL syntax
 * connect databases/services that are responsible for storing or fetching data
 * return graphql data responses
 * validate incoming requests


## Development process : Schema drivin development 

   :dizzy: When building a GraphQL server is that the main development process will revolve around the schema definition

* Define your types and the appropriate queries and mutations for them.
* Implement functions called resolvers to handle these types and their fields.
* keep doing step one and two as you figure shit out :woman_mechanic:
